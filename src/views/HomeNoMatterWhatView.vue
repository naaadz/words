          Where to begin. It’s comforting. It’s coming home from work and her stretching her arms wide for a big hug and
          her asking me how my day was. It’s her making me sit on the vanity counter and gently applying layers of
          moisturizers and potions to my face when it gets too dry after a trip to the mountains. It’s us lying in bed,
          her with one hand in my hair and the other holding a book while she reads to me, us winding down from the day.
          It’s us, lying on opposite sides of the couch with her feet on my stomach while I rub them and we watch tv.
          It’s us, drinking coffee on the porch, me reading and her working a crossword while she hums tunelessly. It’s
          the scent trails of her perfume around the house and on my pillow. It’s her red lipstick prints on wine

          your one. It’s lying in bed with the sheets over our heads on Saturday morning, laughing sleepily and touching
          each others’ faces while we pillow talk. It’s us in the bathtub drinking wine and making plans for our next
          trip. It’s me sitting on the counter, watching her cook and listening to her wax on about whatever is on her
          mind. It’s a whole lot of me following her juicy peach of an ass around the city as she shops and looks at art
          and people watches. It’s me watching her while she watches and looks at everything else, and then me reframing
          my world through her lens. Life was one dimensional and black and white before I met her. Now it’s a
          technicolor sensory overload.
